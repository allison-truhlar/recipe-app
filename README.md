## Overview 👩🏻‍💻

#### Problem Statement
Cooking is a big part of my life. I have a lot of online recipes bookmarked, but I often wish I could:
1. Search them by ingredient
1. View them without ads or reading a long personal journey

#### Product Vision
- The Recipe Keeper app will allow the user to easily save and view online recipes, and to search their entire recipe collection by ingredient. 
- For styling, I would love for the individual recipes to look like they're on recipe cards.

#### MVP Use Cases
- The user can manually save and delete recipes from a collection
- The user can import online recipes that utilize the standard Recipe Schema and have the recipe name, URL, ingredients, and instructions automatically parsed and saved by the app.
- The user can view recipes in-app, and link out to the original recipe
- The user can search their recipe collection by ingredient(s)

## Road Map 🗺️
* [X] Add functionality to parse recipes that utilize the standard Recipe Schema.
* [X] Add authenitication so users can create and see personal recipe collections.
* [X] Add functionality to search by ingredient across all a user's saved recipes.
* [ ] Make the app fully responsive for mobile devices.
* [ ] Change the styling to make the individual recipes appear like they are on recipe cards.
* [ ] Add functionality so that the user can edit a recipe within the app.
