# 🗃️ Recipe Keeper

## Overview

**Problem Statement**
Cooking is a big part of my life. I have a lot of online recipes bookmarked, but I often wish I could:
1. Search them by ingredient
1. View them without ads or reading a long personal journey

**Product Vision**
- The Recipe Keeper app will allow the user to easily save and view online recipes, and to search their entire recipe collection by ingredient. 
- For styling, I would love for the individual recipes to look like they're on recipe cards.

**MVP Use Cases**
- The user can manually save and delete recipes from a collection
- The user can import online recipes that utilize the standard Recipe Schema and have the recipe name, URL, ingredients, and instructions automatically parsed and saved by the app.
- The user can view recipes in-app, and link out to the original recipe
- The user can search their recipe collection by ingredient(s)

## Road Map 🗺️
* [ ] Add functionality to parse recipes that utilize the standard Recipe Schema
* [ ] Add authenitication so users can create and see personal recipe collections
* [ ] Improve the UX for mobile use - for example, move the "add recipe" form to a drawer that is accessed by a hamburger menu.
* [ ] Change the styling to make the individual recipes appear like they are on recipe cards.

## Acknowledgements ✨
- The basics of the app were developed with the help of the Net Ninja MERN Stack Tutorial.
